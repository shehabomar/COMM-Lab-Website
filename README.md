# Life At NYUAD
A Tour in an NYUAD student's life.


### Project Description
We are a group of NYUAD students, and we have created this video to provide a glimpse into the vibrant student life on our campus. At NYUAD, each student leads a unique journey filled with diverse experiences and aspirations. Whether it's engaging in academic pursuits, participating in extracurricular activities, or fostering a sense of community, our campus is a dynamic hub where students from all walks of life come together to learn, grow, and make lasting memories.


### During The Process of Implementing The Project
- Firstly, I did the wireframe to be able to picture the main components of the website.
- Secondly, I used HTML, CSS to implement the structure and the styling of the website.
- Thirdly, I used JS to create some functionality to the components in the website and to make it interactive.
